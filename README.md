## **Phase 1: Sign-In & Authentication**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Enter Your Credentials**  
- Email: `you@company.com`  
- Password: Your account password.  
- If MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is enabled ‚Üí Verify via app, SMS, or call.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Validation by Azure AD**  
Your credentials are sent securely to **Azure Active Directory**, where Microsoft checks:  
- ‚úÖ Are you a valid user?  
- ‚úÖ Is your password correct?  
- ‚úÖ Does your device/location meet company sign-in policies?

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Conditional Access Check (If Enabled)**  
Admins may enforce:  
- MFA for new devices  
- Blocking legacy apps  
- Location-based login restrictions  
- Time-based login rules

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Secure Token Issuance**  
Once validated, Azure AD issues a **sign-in token** ‚Üí Outlook uses this to communicate with Microsoft 365 services without repeatedly asking for your password.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Connection to Exchange Online**  
Outlook connects to **Exchange Online** to load your mailbox, calendar, and contacts.
