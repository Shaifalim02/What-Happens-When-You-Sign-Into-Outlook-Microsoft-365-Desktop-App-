Ever wondered what‚Äôs happening under the hood when you log into **Outlook** on your computer?  
Here‚Äôs the step-by-step breakdown ‚Äî from authentication to offline mailbox storage.

## **Phase 1: Sign-In & Authentication**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Enter Your Credentials**  
- Email: `you@company.com`  
- Password: Your account password.  
- If MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is enabled ‚Üí Verify via app, SMS, or call.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Validation by Azure AD**  
Your credentials are sent securely to **Azure Active Directory**, where Microsoft checks:  
- ‚úÖ Are you a valid user?  
- ‚úÖ Is your password correct?  
- ‚úÖ Does your device/location meet company sign-in policies?

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Conditional Access Check (If Enabled)**  
Admins may enforce:  
- MFA for new devices  
- Blocking legacy apps  
- Location-based login restrictions  
- Time-based login rules

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Secure Token Issuance**  
Once validated, Azure AD issues a **sign-in token** ‚Üí Outlook uses this to communicate with Microsoft 365 services without repeatedly asking for your password.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Connection to Exchange Online**  
Outlook connects to **Exchange Online** to load your mailbox, calendar, and contacts.

## **Phase 2: Cached Exchange Mode & OST File**

If **Cached Exchange Mode** is ON (default for most desktop users):

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Creation of Local Mailbox Copy**  
- Outlook creates an **Offline Storage Table (OST)** file to improve performance and allow offline access.


7Ô∏è‚É£ **OST File Location**  

```plaintext
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\

Example : C:\Users\Shaifali\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\your_email@domain.com.ost
```

### üîÑ 9. Background Sync
Outlook constantly syncs the **OST file** with **Exchange Online** in the background to ensure you're always up to date across all devices.

üí° **Tech Tip:**  
If you‚Äôre facing Outlook performance issues or mailbox corruption, checking the **OST file health or size** is a good place to start.
